In November 2017, we published a story showing that <a href="http://birminghameastside.com/2017/11/08/one-in-every-88-people-are-homeless-in-birmingham/" target="_blank">Birmingham leads cities in the West Midlands with the highest number of people without a place to live.</a> 

The story was based on <a href="http://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/1440053/8112017_Far_From_Alone.pdf" target="_blank">a report released by housing charity Shelter</a>. 

Figures of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-homelessness" target="_blank">homelessness from the Department for Communities and Local Government</a> were also used to give more context to the story.
